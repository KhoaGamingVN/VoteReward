# VoteReward
##The essential voting plugin for your server.

### About:
VoteReward is the original voting plugin for PocketMine-MP servers. With the latest update, the plugin now works with any server lists which choose to comply with VoteReward's API standards. You can now use multiple server lists at the same time. Take a look at the official VoteReward certified server list repository to find some lists to register your server on. The more lists you register your server on and configure VoteReward to use, the more players you'll get! Simply register your server on any certified lists you choose, find and download their custom generated VRC files for your server, drop them in your VoteReward/Lists/ folder, type /vote reload, and watch the players start flooding in!

### Commands:
/vote - Checks to see if you've voted on any lists, and if you have, rewards you for them.
/vote reload - Reloads your configuration file and rescans your Lists folder.
